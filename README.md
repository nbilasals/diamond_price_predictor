# Diamond Price Predictor using KNN, Random Forest, and Boosting Algorithms

This project aims to develop a diamond price predictor using three popular machine learning algorithms: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Random Forest, and Boosting. The objective is to build models that can accurately predict the price of diamonds based on their various attributes.

## Introduction

The diamond price predictor project focuses on utilizing machine learning algorithms to create predictive models for estimating diamond prices. The project utilizes a dataset containing various diamond attributes such as carat weight, cut quality, color grade, clarity grade, and dimensions. By training the models on this dataset, the project aims to develop accurate price predictions for diamonds.

## Features

- Data preprocessing to handle missing values, outliers, and categorical variables
- Feature selection to identify relevant attributes for training the models
- Implementation of KNN, Random Forest, and Boosting algorithms for price prediction
- Evaluation of model performance using evaluation metrics, MAE
- Comparison of the three algorithms to determine the best performing one
